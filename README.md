The system developed is deployed on the web as a website. The website is built on the
backbone of flask, which serves the purpose of providing connectivity between the python code
and the HTML. When the website is loaded, the object detection module starts its processing
and the objects detected by this module are displayed on the page as well as delivered to the
user via an earpiece/speaker. Along with this, we also have two buttons ('Switch to Face' and
'Stop') on the landing page that are well separated to be easily accessible. Clicking on 'Stop'
results in pausing the Livestream until the 'Start' button is clicked. The 'Switch to Face' button
on click will switch to the page where the Face Recognition processing begins.
